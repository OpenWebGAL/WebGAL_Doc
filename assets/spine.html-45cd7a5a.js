Spine, as third-party software, has its runtime components governed by the Spine Editor License Agreement. According to this agreement, any use of software integrating the Spine Runtime requires you to obtain your own legal license for the Spine Editor.</p><p>If you privately integrate or use the WebGAL version integrated with the Spine Runtime without obtaining a Spine Editor license, all resulting legal liabilities, economic losses, reputational damage, and any other consequences shall be borne solely by you or your organization. The WebGAL project team assumes no responsibility for this. We do not provide Spine licenses, nor do we participate in any license acquisition or distribution process. WebGAL only serves as a technical platform, supporting integration with Spine, but does not supervise or take responsibility for your usage.</p><p>Unauthorized use of the Spine Runtime will be considered an infringement and may lead to third-party legal action against you for damages. You agree that any legal disputes or economic compensation claims arising from your violation of the Spine Editor License Agreement shall be resolved by you independently, and you will fully compensate the WebGAL project team and its affiliates for any losses incurred due to your actions, including but not limited to legal fees, compensation, and other related expenses.</p><p>Furthermore, the WebGAL project team expressly disclaims any responsibility for any direct or indirect damage, inconvenience, or loss you may suffer during the integration or use of Spine functionality. Whether due to technical failures, software errors, unauthorized use, or any consequences resulting from your failure to comply with the license agreement, WebGAL shall not bear any responsibility. You must assume full responsibility for all risks and liabilities associated with using the WebGAL version integrated with Spine.</p><p>In summary, if you choose to integrate or use Spine functionality in WebGAL, you must ensure that you have legally obtained a Spine Editor license and commit to complying with all relevant license terms and regulations. Otherwise, all risks, liabilities, and consequences arising therefrom shall be borne by you or your organization and are unrelated to the WebGAL project team.</p><p>By using this software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to all contents of the above disclaimer.
