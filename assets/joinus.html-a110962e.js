With the powerful cross-platform advantage of the web platform, WebGAL can run on almost any device that can run a browser. After more than two years of iteration, WebGAL is now increasingly rich in functions and its stability is also improving step by step. WebGAL is now widely used in the production of visual novel games. Its easy-to-use and efficient editor also enables game makers who lack programming experience to easily develop game works with personal characteristics.</p><p>Now, with the continuous expansion of the user group, we are constantly receiving requests for new functions and bug reports. The existing manpower can no longer support the needs of such a large number of users. Therefore, we hope that there will be a group of capable and ambitious friends who are willing to popularize the production of this type of game and revitalize visual novels/Galgames by creating simple, easy-to-use and powerful engines and production tools, and join us to build the future of WebGAL together.</p><h2 id="webgal-concept" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#webgal-concept" aria-hidden="true">#</a> WebGAL Concept</h2><p>Give talented people easy-to-use tools, and they can create masterpieces. For those engaged in scriptwriting, painting or other art professions, software development is often not their strength. But they have creativity and the passion to create ideal works. The concept of WebGAL is to lower the development threshold as much as possible, so that everyone, regardless of whether they have a programming foundation, can create their own games.</p><h2 id="special-note" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#special-note" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Special Note</h2><p>WebGAL is an open source project, so what we recruit are actually &quot;contributors&quot;.
